### Query from many tables
###### Concatenate rows from two queries from two tables
A set operation that stacks rows vertically, assuming the queries produce compatible result sets. The columns selected (c1 and c2) must match in number, order, and data types across both queries—otherwise, the query fails with errors like "column type mismatch."
``` sql
-- with duplicates
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t1 
UNION ALL 
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t2;
-- without duplicates
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t1 UNION SELECT c1, c2 FROM t2;
```
###### Extract common rows from two queries from two tables
1. Compare rows entirely (all columns: c1 and c2 must match exactly).
2. Retain only rows present in both A and B.
3. Deduplicate: Use sorting, hashing, or temp tables to ensure uniqueness (e.g., if a row appears twice in one set, it's still only once in the result).
4. For INTERSECT ALL (if supported): Count occurrences and take the min per unique row.
``` sql
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t1 INTERSECT SELECT c1, c2 FROM t2;
-- alternative
SELECT DISTINCT t1.c1, t1.c2 
FROM t1 
INNER JOIN t2 
ON t1.c1 = t2.c1 AND t1.c2 = t2.c2;
```
#### JOIN
Aliases (t1 and t2) are used to qualify column names, preventing ambiguity if the same column name exists in both tables. Without aliases, you'd get an error in many SQL dialects if columns overlap.
###### Inner join t1 and t2
An INNER JOIN returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables according to the join condition. Non-matching rows from either table are excluded entirely from the result set. This makes it the most common join type for combining related data while filtering out unpaired records. It's essentially the intersection of the two tables based on the predicate.

For each row in t1, search for rows in t2 where t1.column_name = t2.column_name. Only pairs that match are retained; non-matches are discarded.

Conceptually, it's like a filtered Cartesian product: generate all possible pairs (like CROSS JOIN), then keep only those satisfying the ON clause.
If ON is always true (e.g., ON 1=1), it becomes CROSS JOIN.

Includes all combinations (e.g., if two rows in t1 have same column_name matching three in t2, 2 × 3 = 6 rows).
Rows with NULL in join columns don't match (since NULL = NULL is false in SQL). Use IS NULL or COALESCE if needed.
``` sql
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2 ON condition;
-- Select 1 column from each table
SELECT t1.column1, t2.column2 
FROM table1 t1 
INNER JOIN table2 t2 
ON t1.column_name1 = t2.column_name1 AND t1.column_name2 = t2.column_name2;
```
###### Left join t1 and t2 (Excel VLOOKUP plus rows duplication for one-to-many relationship)
A LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the left table (table1 here) and the matching rows from the right table (table2). 
If one or more matches are found, each match creates a combined row in the result. Therefore if multiple rows in t2 match a single row in t1 (e.g., one-to-many relationship), the left row is duplicated in the result for each match.
If there are no matches for a row in the left table, the result still includes that left row, but with NULL values in the columns from the right table. 

This makes it useful for scenarios where you want to include all records from one side, even if the other side lacks corresponding data.
It's an "outer" join because it preserves non-matching rows from one side (the left).
``` sql
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON condition;
-- Select 1 column from each table
SELECT t1.column1, t2.column2 
FROM table1 t1 
LEFT JOIN table2 t2 
ON t1.column_name = t2.column_name;
```
###### Right join t1 and t2
All rows from the right table (t2) are included.
1. Read all rows from table2 (t2). No right rows are ever excluded.
2. For every row in t2, search for matching rows in t1 based on the ON condition (e.g., equal column_name).
	- If matches exist, create combined rows for each.
	- If no match, create a row with the t2 data and NULLs in t1 columns.
3. If multiple t1 rows match a t2 row (many-to-one), the right row is duplicated for each match.
``` sql
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t1 RIGHT JOIN t2 ON condition;
-- Select 1 column from each table
SELECT t1.column1, t2.column2 
FROM table1 t1 
RIGHT JOIN table2 t2 
ON t1.column_name = t2.column_name;
```
###### Full outer join
A FULL JOIN returns all rows from both tables, including matches and non-matches. For rows without a match in the other table, the missing columns are filled with NULL values.
1. Pair rows where ON condition is true (e.g., equal column_name).
2. For unmatched t1 rows: Include with NULLs in t2 columns.
3. For unmatched t2 rows: Include with NULLs in t1 columns.
Duplicates if one-to-many (e.g., one t1 row matches multiple t2 → multiple rows).

This combines the behaviors of LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN, providing a complete union of both datasets with matches where possible. Conceptually, it's the union of LEFT and RIGHT JOINs without duplicates.
``` sql
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t1 FULL OUTER JOIN t2 ON condition;
-- Select 1 column from each table
SELECT t1.column1, t2.column2 
FROM table1 t1 
FULL JOIN table2 t2 
ON t1.column_name = t2.column_name;
-- Equivalent with LEFT and RIGHT JOIN
SELECT t1.column1, t2.column2 FROM table1 t1 LEFT JOIN table2 t2 ON t1.column_name = t2.column_name
UNION
SELECT t1.column1, t2.column2 FROM table1 t1 RIGHT JOIN table2 t2 ON t1.column_name = t2.column_name;
```
###### Cross join a Cartesian product of rows in tables
For each row in table1, it pairs it with every single row in table2.
If Table A has m rows and Table B has n rows, the result will have m × n rows.
The SELECT clause then projects the specified columns from these paired rows.
CROSS JOIN does not require an ON condition. It combines every row from the first table with every row from the second table, regardless of any matching criteria.
``` sql
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t1 CROSS JOIN t2;
-- Select 1 column from each table
SELECT t1.column1, t2.column2 
FROM table1 t1 
CROSS JOIN table2 t2;
-- Alternative old style syntax
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t1, t2
```
###### Intersection of data with JOIN. Finding overlaps for matching rows for columns c1 and c2 in both tables:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT t1.c1, t1.c2 
FROM t1 
INNER JOIN t2 
ON t1.c1 = t2.c1 AND t1.c2 = t2.c2;
-- alternative
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t1 INTERSECT SELECT c1, c2 FROM t2;
```
#### Selection combinations
##### A set subtraction between two result sets
It returns all unique rows from the first query (`SELECT c1, c2 FROM t1`) that are not present in the second query (`SELECT c1, c2 FROM t2`).
MINUS is used in Oracle, DB2, and some others. Identify rows in A that have no exact match in B (whole-row comparison: c1 and c2 must match). Deduplicate within the result. For EXCEPT ALL (if supported): Subtract counts (e.g., if row appears 3 times in A and 2 in B, result has 1).
Equivalent to EXCEPT in PostgreSQL, SQL Server, SQLite, MySQL (v8.0.31+), and ANSI SQL standard.
**Edge Cases:**
- No uniques in A: Empty.
- B empty: All unique from A.
- A subset of B: Empty.
- Duplicates in A: Removed if not in B.
```sql
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t1 MINUS SELECT c1, c2 FROM t2;
-- alternative
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t1 EXCEPT SELECT c1, c2 FROM t2;
-- alternative
SELECT t1.c1, t1.c2 
FROM t1 
LEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.c1 = t2.c1 AND t1.c2 = t2.c2 
WHERE t2.c1 IS NULL;
```
##### Selection based on pattern matching in single column
The LIKE operator enables pattern matching on string data, allowing flexible searches for substrings or patterns rather than exact equality (e.g., via =). It uses two special wildcards:
- % (percent sign): Matches any sequence of zero or more characters (like a multi-character wildcard).
- _ (underscore): Matches exactly one character (like a single-character wildcard).
```sql
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t1 WHERE c1 LIKE pattern;
-- reverse matching alternative
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t1 WHERE c1 NOT LIKE pattern;
-- example for rows starting with 'abc'
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t1 WHERE c1 LIKE 'abc%';
-- example for rows having 'a_c' which matches "abc", "a1c" but not "ac" or "abcc"
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t1 WHERE c1 LIKE 'a_c';
-- example for rows having 'a_c' as substring matches (a, any character, b)
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t1 WHERE c1 LIKE '%a_b%';
-- example for rows having '100%' which requires escape character
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t1 WHERE c1 LIKE '100\%' ESCAPE '\';  
```
##### Selection based on list
This performs a selection of rows from table t, retrieving columns c1 and c2, but only for rows where the value in c1 is (or is not, if NOT is included) present in the specified value_list.
The IN operator is a shorthand for checking membership in a set of values, equivalent to multiple OR conditions (e.g., c1 = val1 OR c1 = val2 ...).
**NULL Issues:**
- c1 NULL: Excluded.
- List has NULL: NOT IN always false if any NULL (can't confirm "not equal" to NULL).
- Fix: Filter NULLs (e.g., WHERE c1 NOT IN (...) AND c1 IS NOT NULL).
```sql
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t WHERE c1 IN value_list;
-- reverse matching alternative
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t WHERE c1 NOT IN value_list;
-- example for the list of 2 values
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t WHERE c1 IN ('apple', 'banana');
-- example for the list of 3 numerical values
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t WHERE c1 IN (1,2,3);
-- example with subquery
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t WHERE c1 IN (SELECT id FROM other_table WHERE status = 'active');
```
